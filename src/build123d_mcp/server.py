_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Persistent CAD modeling server for build123d. Use these tools for ANY task that
builds, modifies, measures, or renders 3D geometry or engineering drawings —
"model this part", "build this from the technical drawing", "does A fit inside
B", "make a drawing of X" — instead of writing standalone Python scripts run
via the shell. The server keeps a persistent build123d session, so you can
build incrementally with execute(), verify each step numerically with measure()
(volume, bounding box, face inventory), inspect visually with render_view(),
compare shapes/fits/snapshots with compare(), and undo experiments with
snapshots — a feedback loop a one-shot script cannot give.

Quick start: execute("from build123d import *"), build in small steps,
register parts with show(part, "name"), measure() after every boolean,
export() when done. Read the build123d://quickref resource before writing
build code. Step-by-step workflows: build123d://skill/modeling (build 3D
parts, incl. from technical drawings), build123d://skill/edit (modify an
existing model), build123d://skill/drawing (multi-view engineering drawings),
and build123d://skill/repair (repair a solid that fails the validity gate);
install any into the project with
install_skill().

BUILD123D-MCP WORKFLOW GUIDE

1. ORIENT FIRST
   At the start of a session, call session_state() to see what geometry, objects, and
   snapshots are already active. Call health_check() if you suspect a missing dependency
   (VTK, display, STEP export). Call version() to confirm the server version.

2. MEASURE BEFORE YOU LOOK
   After building or modifying geometry, verify with measure() before calling render_view.
   Numbers are unambiguous; renders can look correct even when the geometry is wrong.
   Recommended order: execute → measure → render_view (if you need to see it).
   Compose in code: measure/clearance/cross_sections/find_holes/find_bosses/
   find_bored_bosses/find_countersinks/find_hole_patterns/align_check are Python helpers callable INSIDE execute() and
   return real objects — measure(part)["volume"], [h for h in find_holes(part) if
   h.location[0] < 5] — so filter/compute in code instead of copying numbers out of a
   JSON tool result. For standalone MCP fit/alignment/shape/snapshot comparisons,
   use compare(a="part", b="mate", kind="fit"),
   compare(a="a", b="b", kind="align"), compare(a="before", b="after", kind="shape"),
   or compare(a="before", kind="snapshot").

3. VERIFY BOOLEAN OPERATIONS WITH TOPOLOGY
   After any cut, union, or intersection, call measure() and check topology.faces.
   A successful boolean changes face/edge/vertex counts; a failed one leaves them unchanged.
   measure().volume confirms the magnitude of the change.

4. MEASURE THE OBJECT IN QUESTION — NOT A PROXY
   When debugging, call measure() on the actual disputed object.
   Testing an isolated reconstruction and using that as proof of the full assembly is a
   common mistake — the two may differ in ways that matter.

5. NAME AND AUDIT YOUR SHAPES
   Use show(shape, "name") after creating important geometry — it also sets current_shape.
   The execute() output immediately confirms name, volume, and face count.
   Call session_state() for a full JSON view of all active shapes, objects, and snapshots.
   session_state() includes the named-object list — no separate list_objects() call needed.

6. CHECKPOINT BEFORE EXPERIMENTS — AND PROPOSALS
   Call save_snapshot("name") before any operation you might want to undo.
   Snapshots are instant. restore_snapshot("name") reverts geometry without re-running code.
   Use compare(a="name", kind="snapshot") to see what changed; pass format="json" for structured output.

   "What if?" proposals: when asked to evaluate a possible modification (add a hole here,
   widen this slot, swap this part), the right pattern is:
       save_snapshot("before")   # cheap; geometry-only
       <apply the proposed change via execute()>
       <run analyses: measure(), compare(a="part", b="mate", kind="fit"), cross_sections(), render_view()>
       restore_snapshot("before")  # canonical model untouched
   Use this instead of redrawing the geometry in matplotlib or editing the source file.
   The 3D mutation + 3D analysis loop is cheaper than re-deriving geometry by hand,
   and the restore guarantees the canonical model isn't accidentally touched.

7. CROSS-SECTIONS FOR INTERNAL GEOMETRY
   render_view with clip_plane + clip_at reveals interior features.
   Use clip_at to position the cut at a specific world coordinate, not just the midpoint.
   Combine with measure(topology) on the unclipped shape to confirm what you see.

8. PART LIBRARY
   search_library("keyword") returns full parameter specs.
   Call load_part("name", '{"param": value}') immediately — no second lookup needed.
   Unspecified parameters use the defaults shown in search results.

9. BD_WAREHOUSE FASTENERS, THREADS, GEARS, BEARINGS
   bd_warehouse ships with this server — import it directly in execute() instead of
   hand-rolling threads, fasteners, gears, or bearings (a 5-line Thread beats a fiddly
   helical sweep). version() lists installed companion packages.
   Read the build123d://bd_warehouse resource before scripting any fastener geometry.
   Always probe sizes before writing the script to get the correct string format:
     execute('from bd_warehouse.fastener import CounterSunkScrew; print(CounterSunkScrew.sizes("iso10642"))')
   Use CounterSinkHole/TapHole/ClearanceHole/CounterBoreHole with the fastener object —
   never compute head geometry or tap-drill diameters manually.

10. COMPLEX / HEAVY BUILDS
   The execute() timeout (default 120s) hard-limits a SINGLE call, not the session: if a
   call times out only that step is dropped and the session is rebuilt from your prior
   execute() history (variables, shapes, named objects come back). So the first move is to
   stay in-session and go smaller/longer, NOT to leave for Bash:
     a) Build incrementally in several smaller execute() calls (a timed-out step is dropped,
        the rest of the session survives), and/or
     b) Raise the ceiling: --exec-timeout N or BUILD123D_EXEC_TIMEOUT=N (also extends the
        import budget for heavy STEP files).
   Only if a single unavoidable op (IsoThread, a multi-body fillet, a very high-face-count
   boolean) still won't fit, drop out for that one op: write it as a Python script, run it
   with Bash, then import_cad_file("part.step", "part") and verify with measure()/render_view().

11.5. 2D DRAWINGS — TWO FLAVOURS
   For dimensioned 2D drawings, use build123d.drafting (Draft / ExtensionLine /
   DimensionLine / TechnicalDrawing) inside execute() to compose the drawing.
   The result is a Sketch or Compound — review it with render_view(objects="...")
   exactly like a 3D part (the server auto-detects 2D and pipes through the
   ezdxf+matplotlib path), and ship it with export(name, "dxf").

   Two cookbooks for two audiences:
   - build123d://drafting — engineering drawings for fabrication: tolerance
     dims, TechnicalDrawing title block, multi-view sheets, hole tables.
     Two-colour output (black part + blue dims).
   - build123d://presentation — design-discussion diagrams: per-group colour
     via ExportSVG layers, filled feature highlights, legends, reference
     axes, Draft scaling for small parts. Multi-colour SVG, run from a
     small script outside the MCP sandbox (the sandbox blocks
     ExportSVG.write()). Use this for chat / doc / proposal output.

   The defining recipe in the presentation cookbook is "scale Draft to your
   part size" — Draft defaults are tuned for A4, and on a 25-mm-wide part the
   default line_width=0.5 and arrow_length=3.0 make witness lines render as
   thick filled rectangles. Override every parameter, not just font_size.

   For a guided multi-view drawing workflow (choose views, scale/page size,
   annotate, lint, export SVG/DXF/PDF), call install_skill() to write a
   step-by-step skill file into the current project, or read the skill directly
   from the build123d://skill/drawing resource.

11. IMPORTING EXTERNAL FILES
   After import_cad_file(), the shape is a named object — use render_view(objects="name")
   to visualise it. If the session also contains the original built shape at the same
   position, always render by name to avoid Z-fighting (striped colour artifacts).
   STL imports produce a shell (volume=0); render_view and measure work, but
   compare(a="stl", b="solid", kind="fit") and boolean operations require a solid.

12. ASSEMBLIES — USE JOINTS, NOT JUST .move()
   For assemblies of two or more parts that have a real mechanical relationship
   (mounted on, hinged to, slides along), reach for build123d Joints rather than
   positioning parts with .move() / Location(). RigidJoint expresses a fixed
   mount; RevoluteJoint a hinge; LinearJoint a slider; CylindricalJoint
   rotate-and-slide; BallJoint a 3-axis pivot.
   The benefit: move the parent later, the child follows. With raw .move() the
   relationship is lost.
   Pattern (rigid mount):
     RigidJoint("mount", to_part=plate, joint_location=Location((0, 0, 2.5)))
     RigidJoint("base",  to_part=pin,   joint_location=Location((0, 0, -5)))
     plate.joints["mount"].connect_to(pin.joints["base"])
   See build123d://quickref for joint type details and movable-joint examples.

7. Call save_snapshot("name") before any experiment you might want to undo.
   For "what if?" proposals (add a hole, modify a feature) use the snapshot+restore loop:
   save_snapshot → mutate via execute → run analyses (measure/compare/render_view) → restore_snapshot.
   This is cheaper and more accurate than redrawing geometry in matplotlib to evaluate a change.
8. For assemblies of two or more parts with a mechanical relationship (mounted, hinged, sliding),
   use Joints (RigidJoint/RevoluteJoint/LinearJoint/CylindricalJoint/BallJoint) rather than raw
   .move() — the relationship survives later changes. See build123d://quickref for examples.
9. When complete: export("part", "step,stl").
10. For 2D drawings, two cookbooks for two audiences:
   - build123d://drafting   — engineering drawings for fabrication handoff.
   - build123d://presentation — design-discussion diagrams (per-group colour,
     filled features, legends, axes, titles). Read this when the audience is
     a human reviewing a design rather than a fabricator.

Read the build123d://quickref resource before writing execute() code — it has accurate API syntax.
Read the build123d://bd_warehouse resource for fastener/bearing/thread catalogue and usage patterns.
Call workflow_hints() if unsure which tool to use next.
